# Introduction {#intro}

*This section is not normative.*

Although [[RFC1918]] has specified a distinction between "private" and "public"
internet addresses for over two decades, user agents havenâ€™t made much progress
at segregating the one from the other. Websites on the public internet can make
requests to local devices and servers, which enable a number of malicious
behaviors, including attacks on users' routers like those documented in
[[DRIVE-BY-PHARMING]], [[SOHO-PHARMING]] and [[CSRF-EXPLOIT-KIT]].

Local Network Access aims to prevent these undesired requests to insecure
devices on the local network. This is achieved by deprecating direct access to
local IP addresses from public websites, and instead requiring that the user
grants permission to the initiating website to make connections to their local
network.

*Note:* This proposal builds on top of Chrome's previously paused
[[PRIVATE-NETWORK-ACCESS]] work but differs by gating access on a permission
rather than via preflight requests.
